# U.S Teen Birth Rate 

This is a completion of the 6 weeks Final Project requirement of the Entity Academy / Woz-U Data Science curriculum by Lucy Thuku and Virginia Mburu Brovant.

# Background

The purpose of this project is to explore the rates in teenage births in the United States for a certain period.(2014-2020)
The team members chose this topic because they were both curios to see how the number of teen births in the United States has changed over the years and if there were any significant regional differences in the number of births. The topic was inspired by their own personal challenges as young mothers.

# Datasets

# Data Wrangling

After gathering the data, there was a bit of reformatting that was done using Python on Jupyter Notebook. Much of this reformatting was an attribute of reclassification, which involved converting data from a string format to something more appropriate such as date. The data was also trimmed down to its most concise, useful form to make the rows and columns as simple as possible while still providing useful insight.

# Data Exploration

Much of the goal here was to provide a platform for self-discovery using interactive maps and graphs. Key summary statistics and figures were highlighted to get a basic understanding of the events and overall context of the data.

# Data Analysis

Dependent t-tests were used to analyze the correlation between teen birth rates over the years between different states.

# Data Visualization

Based on the results and findings from their analysis, visualizations were created in both Python and Tableau.

# Data Reporting and Presentation

Project was presented via Zoom on March 21st 2020 to Woz U / Entity Academy faculty.
